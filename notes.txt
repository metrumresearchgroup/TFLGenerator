-- panel for exclusions only generates once.  Likely due to isolate, how to get around this?  Reactive value for only one column of reactive dataframe?
-- look into unit testing
-- Example for specifying exclusions:

OE <- "Keep"
OE[ DV < 0.05 ] <- "BQL"
OE[ TAFD > 500 ] <- "Observation after end of study"

SUBEX <- "Keep"
SUBEX[ RACE=="88" | RACE==88 ] <- "Missing race"
