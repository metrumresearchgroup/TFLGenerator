-- panel for exclusions only generates once.  Likely due to isolate, how to get around this?  Reactive value for only one column of reactive dataframe?
-- look into unit testing
-- Example for specifying exclusions:

ObsExc <- "Keep"
ObsExc[ DV < 0.05 ] <- "BQL"
ObsExc[ TAFD > 100 ] <- "EOS"

SubjExc <- "Keep"
SubjExc[ RACE=="88" | RACE==88 ] <- "Missing race"
