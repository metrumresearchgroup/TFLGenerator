==========================================
Set up instructions for the TFL generator

1) Launch an Envision workflow (recommended to use 8 core)
1) Place this directory somewhere in /data (e.g., /data/tflgenerator)
2) As root, run asRootpkgSetup.R (e.g., cd script; sudo R CMD BATCH asRootpkgSetup.R)
3) As you, run pkgSetup.R (e.g., cd script; R CMD BATCH pkgSetup.R)
4) Via Metworx dashboard, check to see if the Envision app is running (TFL generator)
